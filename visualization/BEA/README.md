# US Bureau of Economic Analysis API
Gaining exposure to APIs and Python using the BEA API. 
All pybea and user-guide.ipynb files are originally from David R. Pugh's [pyBEA repository](https://github.com/davidrpugh/pyBEA). Some modifications have been made to indicate requests to obsolete datasets. 
### Plans:
- Continue getting familiar with the BEA API; specifically, extract datasets and determine what the contents are
- Search for current economic data (BEA data seems to only go until 2019Q4)
- Search for global economic data
